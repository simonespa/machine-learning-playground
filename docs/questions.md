# Questions

- When to apply scaling?
- When to use stratified sampling?
- Do we transform the train set only or the test set too?
- If we transform the train set only, when we do prediction should the data be transformed too?
- In `sickit-learn` transformers have the `fit`, `transform` and `fit_transform` methods. The example have the fit being called before transforming the dataset. Shouldn't we transform before fitting?
- What do we use for a stratified sampling, should it be a categorical attribute? Should we consider any random attribute or only the ones that are strong predictors?
