# Bias

Bias is a systematic error in the analysis.

There are manny types of bias. To keep it short, I'll describe just some of them here and for completeness add some links.

## Sampling bias

This bias is introduced when a sample is not representative of the overall population. Namely, when groups of the population in respect of a certain trait are over/under sampled for various reasons. For example, the methodology used to sample a population favour a specific demografic in a population.

### Non-response bias

It's a special type of **sampling bias** and occurs when non-responders from a sample differ in a meaningful way from the population.
