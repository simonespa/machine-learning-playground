- Introduction to machine learning
  - Glossary
  - Topography: AI, ML, Datascience, Datamining
  - Distinction between types: supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement, online/offline, ....
    - Regression, Classification
- Concept of prediction
  - Introduce regression
  - Draw the function with just one parameter
  - Write the function
  - Introduce the concept of error and cost function
    - Intuition of what error menas on the graph
    - Talk about the distance between the point and the projection on the approximation function
    - Different type of costs function
      - Just the distance, but then there are negative numbers
      - The absolute value
      - The square value
  - Draw the cost function
  - Talk about why convexity is key for optimisation
    - Convex set: draw the shapes (circle, square, and something non convex) and show the line that joins 2 points
    - Concept of epigraph: points
    - Definition: a function F is convex iif its epigraph is a convex set
    - Numerical definition: a function F is convex if the second-order derivative (F'') is greater than or equal to zero
  - Explore the concept of momentum for non convex functions
