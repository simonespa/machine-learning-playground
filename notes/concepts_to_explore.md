Shap values
glorified feature importance - linearization of predictions

Linear probing
take a model that was trained on a task, such as language model. we generate a represenation using the model and train another classifier that takse the representation and preicts some property. if the classifier performs well we say that the model has

Mechanistic interpretability

Grokking: quickly overfit early in training, but then later it generalises

Attention mechanism

Ablation

## Phases
- Memorisation
- Generalisation
- Cleanup: (reducing the weights to reduce the noise)

Starts memorising (the test loss is bad)
