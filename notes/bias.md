# Bias

Bias is a systematic error in the analysis.

There are manny types of bias. To keep it short, I'll describe just some of them here and for completeness add some links.

## Sampling bias

This bias is introduced when a sample is not representative of the overall population. Namely, when groups of the population in respect of a certain trait are over/under sampled for various reasons. For example, the methodology used to sample a population favour a specific demografic in a population.

### Non-response bias

It's a special type of **sampling bias** and occurs when non-responders from a sample differ in a meaningful way from the population.

## Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values.

Specific effects:

- attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence)
- belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false)
- the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series)
- illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

People may show confirmation bias because they are pragmatically assessing the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.
