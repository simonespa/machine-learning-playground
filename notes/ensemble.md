# Ensemble

> Ensembles essentially settle in many distant low-loss valleys, yielding a distribution of diverse functions (Fort, Hu, and Lakshminarayanan 2019). On the other hand, alternative methods such as MC dropout and alternative Bayesian approaches will hone in to just one valley, yielding a distribution of similar functions.
