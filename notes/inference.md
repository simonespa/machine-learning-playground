# Inference

There are three forms of inference:

- deduction: from the universal to the particular
- induction: from the particular to the universal
- abduction: from an observation to the universal

All three inferences can increase knowledge. Induction and abduction, however, require empirical verification given that they do not contain a logical truth within them. But it is only through abduction that we can formulate new ideas, remembering that there is a margin of error.

Abduction is forming a hypothesis, induction is like analyzing the data from testing a hypothesis, and deduction would be used in drawing certain logical conclusions from the data gathered.

## Deduction

Deductive reasoning deals with **certainty** and involves reasoning toward certain conclusions.

Conclusion --> Observation

Deductive inference or deductive reasoning is a reasoning approach that involves reaching a conclusion based on knowledge or information that is presumably true. A deductive learning system learns or studies facts or verifiable knowledge.

Deductive learning is a top-down reasoning type that studies all aspects before reaching a specific observation.

## Induction

Inductive reasoning deals with **probability** and involves reasoning toward likely conclusions (based on data). Induction can be defined as inference of general rules that explain certain data.

Observation --> Conclusion

With induction, you generalise a conclusion (general theory) from empirical observations

Inductive learning or inductive reasoning is also a mechanism in data science that, in contrast to deductive reasoning, predicts outcomes based on little evidence.

Inductive learning is a bottom-up reasoning approach that utilizes a specific observation as evidence to conclude.

## Abduction

Abductive reasoning deals with **possibility** and involves reasoning toward possible conclusions (based on guesswork).

It's the process of forming a hypothesis that explains given observed phenomena. Abduction is a generalization of induction.

It is a type of reasoning that is used in formulating a hypothesis for further testing.

## Summary

**Deductive reasoning**, or **deduction**, is making an inference based on widely accepted facts or premises. If a beverage is defined as "drinkable through a straw," one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage.

**Inductive reasoning**, or **induction**, is making an inference based on an observation, often of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends consuming it.

**Abductive reasoning**, or **abduction**, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon. But is it?
