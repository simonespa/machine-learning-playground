# Inference

## Deduction

Conclusion --> Observation

Deductive inference or deductive reasoning is a reasoning approach that involves reaching a conclusion based on knowledge or information that is presumably true. A deductive learning system learns or studies facts or verifiable knowledge.

Deductive learning is a top-down reasoning type that studies all aspects before reaching a specific observation.

## Induction

Observation --> Conclusion

With induction, you generalise a conclusion (general theory) from empirical observations

Inductive learning or inductive reasoning is also a mechanism in data science that, in contrast to deductive reasoning, predicts outcomes based on little evidence.

Inductive learning is a bottom-up reasoning approach that utilizes a specific observation as evidence to conclude.
