# Artificial Intelligence

There is no official definitio to describe Artificial Intelligence. One can say that AI is the ability to think and act like a human.

We could define 4 different AI approaches:
- Thinking humanly: mimicking thought based on the human mind.
- Thinking rationally: mimicking thought based on logical reasoning.
- Acting humanly: acting in a manner that mimics human behaviour.
- Acting rationally: acting in a manner that is meant to achieve a particular goal.

Now, human intelligence is a mental quality that consists of the abilities to:
- learn from experience,
- adapt to new situations,
- understand and handle abstract concepts
- use knowledge to manipulate oneâ€™s environment

Adaptation is the most agreed on, and it draws upon a number of cognitive processes:
as perception, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving.
