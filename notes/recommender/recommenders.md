# Recommenders

## Explicit feedbacks

Users are asked to provide a rating or to react to content with pre-designed interactions to provide their level of interest.
Although the information comes directly from the user, not everyone may provide informations, or the same person may not provide info to every single content. This makes the data sparse.


- Sparse data
- Rating inconsistencies (differencies in people)

## Implicit feedbacks

Feedback is inferred by user interactions with the content. For example, if the user watches a video until a certain % of its duration, we may consider this interaction as an intention (positive/negative)

- Data are not sparse, but may be unreliable
