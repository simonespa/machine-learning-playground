# Variables

Variables can be **quantitative** or **qualitative**.

## Quantitative variables

Quantitative variables represent a measure (a quantity) and can be:

- **Continuous**: real numbers such as 0.75 grams, 0.05 probability, etc.
- **Discrete**: integer numbers such as 1 apple, 10 cars, etc.

## Qualitative variables

Also known as categorical variables, they refer to a characteristic that can't be quantified, but can be qualified. Categorical variable can be:

- **Nominal**: represent names, labels or groups without a natural order: such as brands of a product, car models, etc.
  - **Binary**: represent binary values such as: yes/no, true/false, 1/0 outcome. This is a special case of nominal variables.
- **Ordinal**: represent data with an order relationship between the values: such as rankings, rating of a product, etc.

## Caveat

Not all numerical variables are quantitative. Ordinal categorical variables could be represented with numbers. In rating/ranking for example, the numbers represent the order relationship. A 5-star rating is better (greater) than a 4-star one. The value are expressed with numbers, but mathematical operations on them won't have any meaning.
