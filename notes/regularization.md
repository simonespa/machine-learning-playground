# Regularization
- Lasso (L1 norm): absolute values. Sets the weight of unimportant features to zero which is equivalent to feature elimination
- Ridge (L2 norm): squared values. The weights are reduced but not set to zero.
- Elastic Net includes both and it is the best of both worlds and does a better job at dealing with correlated variables.
