- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)


It is a generative model built on top of LDM and uses several techniques to make the latent diffusion model more stable and efficient.

Stable Diffusion focuses on modeling the energy or density of the data distribution and adds noise directly to the data during training. Latent Diffusion models the data likelihood in the latent space and applies noise to the latent variables.
