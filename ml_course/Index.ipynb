    "**Calculus** is the mathematics of change. It stydies how $y$ changes relative to $x$ (2D) or how $z$ and $y$ change relative to $x$, $y$ relative to $z$, etc. (3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Calculus** is the extension of Calculus to multiple dimensions (vector spaces from linear algebra).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important because by studying the change of the variables in each dimension, we can control the shape of the function/model. They are called \"parameters\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It also have functions that calculate the \"goodness\" (or \"fitness\") of these parameters with respect of the function. It is called \"objective function\" which we aim to optimise. It can be minimised if it is a loss function or maximised if it is a reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With vector calculus, we can calculate how changing the \"parameters\" affect the change of the \"error\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reducing the error is called \"Learning\".\n",

    "**Optimisation** is a method used to find the \"best\" solution given the initial state. Optimisation could be done by minimising or maximising. Most of the time it is costrained by a set of rules. **Machine Learning** is a subfield of optimisation.\n",

This means that we can't provide labels/right answers that the system can learn from. Every decision that the system makes, changes the environment.\n",
